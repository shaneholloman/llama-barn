## Issues

Use GitHub Issues for bug reports.

## Discussions

Use GitHub Discussions for feature requests and ideas.

As an early stage product, we prioritize easy wins (clear benefits, minimal costs, no ongoing maintenance burden) and high-leverage features (broad user impact, foundational improvements that enable future work).

We use Discussions to gather community feedback and gauge interest without cluttering the issue tracker. If a feature in Discussions is selected for development, we will open an Issue to track it.

## Pull Requests

Don't create PRs unless explicitly requested. Open an issue first.

Exception: Simple bug fixes (one file, obvious correctness, no architectural decisions) can be submitted directly.
