## Issues

Found a bug? Open an issue.

**Feature requests:** This is an early stage product. Only open issues for high priority work that makes sense for the current state of the project - either easy wins or major improvements. The tracker is for actionable work that matters now, not "someday" features or wishlists.

Issues that don't meet this bar will be closed. If something becomes important later, it can be re-opened.

## Pull Requests

**Don't create PRs unless explicitly requested.** Open an issue first.

**Exception:** Simple bug fixes (one file, obvious correctness, no architectural decisions) can be submitted directly.
