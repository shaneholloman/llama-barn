## Issues

Use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

**Feature requests:** This is an early stage product focused on actionable, high-impact work — either easy wins (clear benefits, minimal costs, no ongoing maintenance burden) or important features that matter now.

The tracker is for work that matters now, not "someday" features or wishlists. Issues that don't meet this bar will be closed, but can be re-opened if priorities change.

## Pull Requests

**Don't create PRs unless explicitly requested.** Open an issue first.

**Exception:** Simple bug fixes (one file, obvious correctness, no architectural decisions) can be submitted directly.
